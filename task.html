        Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who was also known as Mahatma, "Great Soul" Gandhi, was a hero, as well as a political and spiritual leader of India. He was of the Hindu faith, of which I am too. Mohandas brought India to independence by using non-violent resistance. He thought that there was injustice being served to the Indians, especially to the immigrants by the South Africans. Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869 in Porbandar, Kathiawar, now known as Gujarat. Gandhi passed away at the age of 78 on January 30, 1948. Mahatma Gandhi was brought up in India near Rajkot, where he did most of his studies. In 1888, Gandhi went to London, leaving his wife and son behind, to pursue his degree in law. Later in 1893, Gandhi went to South Africa to work and found that there was a lot of prejudice towards Indians. That was the reason Gandhi began protesting and eventually he became an inspiring hero for millions. The three main qualities that define Gandhi as a hero are his strong leadership, simplicity and bravery.
        Leadership was one of Gandhi's heroic qualities. One way he demonstrated leadership was by encouraging people in his village to start using homespun clothing. Homespun was one of Gandhi’s favorite hobbies. Introducing homespun to his village promised the growth of the village’s economy. The poor became employed to make homespun clothes for others in the village and outside of their own village. This drastically diminished the poverty in Gandhi’s village. Moreover, Gandhi ended the issue of discrimination against untouchables. Back in those days, the Hindus used to discriminate against the untouchables, who were their own kind but just low in the caste system. The untouchables are just another word to describe poor, less educated people who really didn’t fit in with the middle class people. Gandhi made the Hindus realize that what British people were doing to them is the same thing that they were doing to the untouchables. This made the Hindus realize what they were doing to the untouchables. Last but not least, the Indian Independence Movement was the all-time heroic deed led by Gandhi. This movement was accomplished in 1947 by Mahatma. This movement took place because India was governed by the British, and Gandhi wanted India to become independent. Therefore, Gandhi showcased many outstanding leadership skills that made him a hero.
        Simplicity is the second most heroic quality that Gandhi demonstrated. Gandhi believed in living a simple life. He wanted a simple life, with only the necessities that he needed. Even though he was a barrister (a lawyer), he had no arrogance. He dressed like a poor person and he only wore clothes that were homespun, made out of khadi (cotton). He was a vegetarian and then became a fruitarian; many days he would go without eating and would not complain. He was also a man of truth because everything he did and said, he did it with truth. Because he believed in truth, he wrote a book titled, The Story of My Experiments with Truth. Moreover, even though he did many heroic things, he claimed to be an average man: "I claim to be no more than an average man with less than average ability" (pg 112). This quote tells the readers that he did not want to be known as Gandhi, he did not want everyone worshiping him, and he was just proving that he is an average person like others. In addition, what made him a hero can make anyone a hero, only if they have the will to do the right thing and if they believe in truth, nonviolence and creating peace among others. As a result, Gandhi believed that simplicity and truth can make anyone a hero.
        Bravery is another quality that describes Gandhi. Gandhi did many big things that show how brave he was. The first example of his brave work was the Dandi March. The Dandi March was an Indian march led by Gandhi for salt. This was the first act of opposition towards the British and the beginning of the movement to get India's independence. Gandhi broke the Salt Law made by the British and was imprisoned for many years. The Dandi March, with more than enough Indians and with the support of Gandhi, diminished the Salt Tax that people had to pay. Gandhi was also very brave to fight for his country on his own and also to sacrifice himself. Many times he got beaten up by the British people, but he did not say one word. He did not execute any type of violent behavior towards them. This is because he was a strong believer in nonviolence. Lastly, Gandhi showed bravery by doing what he believed was right. He believed that things can be done with love and not war, which definitely results in peace. He believed in his own principles for many years till he died, and he fought for India believing that the only way to end the hatred and war is through peace and love. For that reason, Gandhi is a true hero to all because of his bravery and what he did for Indias independence.

        Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation, was an anti-colonial nationalist who embraced non-violence as a tool to attain freedom for his motherland. A staunch believer in non-violence and truth, he began and continued a resistance campaign against the British till the end. A lawyer by profession, he changed with the times and was a politician, a social activist, and a writer simultaneously. Immensely loved and deeply respected political and spiritual leader of his times, he helped and led the Indian masses through a non-violent resistance movement to attain freedom. The world bows to his greatness. To his countrymen, he is Bapu or Father of the Nation.
        Mohandas did his early schooling at a school in Rajkot, where he studied history, geography, arithmetic, and languages. Later, he shifted to a high school situated in Rajkot. His marriage affected his education, but he re-joined school and completed his education. In 1888, he joined the Samaldas College in Bhavnagar. He was unsatisfied with his education, convinced his parents and managed to go to London to study Law. Before leaving for London, he promised his family that he would not touch non-vegetarian food, women, and wine. In London, he joined Inner Temple Law College and also joined a veg society. People in the society introduced him to the Bhagavad Gita. The Bhagavad Gita influenced him deeply. 
        In South Africa
        In May 1893, he left for South Africa to establish his law practice. He had a terrible experience of racial discrimination in South Africa. Despite holding a 1st class train ticket, he was not allowed to travel in the 1st class as the compartment was reserved only for white people. In those days, Indians and blacks were prohibited from entering or travelling first class. It was an eye-opening and humiliating experience for Mohandas. He later realised that it was a common occurrence, and Indians were treated in a derogatory manner there.
        Deeply affected, Gandhi formed the Natal Indian Congress on 22nd May 1894. He strived hard to improve the rights and conditions of Indians in South Africa. Soon he became a leader of the Indian community there. Tirukkural is ancient Indian literature scripted initially in Tamil and later translated into different languages. The ancient wisdom in the book influenced Mohandas. 
        The idea of satyagraha appealed to him, and in 1906 he arranged a non-violent protest in South Africa against the injustice and discrimination suffered by the Indians and the Africans. After spending 21 years of his life in South Africa, he returned to India in 1915. He was a changed man. Years of fighting the system for the civil rights of his people, achieving some, and being refused much had given him new wisdom and confidence.
        Role in the Indian Independence Movement
        After returning to India permanently, he joined the Indian National Congress. Gopal Krishna Gokhale was his mentor at that time. In 1917-18, Gandhi led the Champaran agitation of Bihar and the Kheda agitation of Gujarat. He initiated and led other Non-Cooperation Movements, Civil disobedience Movements, Swaraj, and Quit India Movement.
